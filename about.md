I'm Aaron, a young student trying to get better at cybersecurity and computer science. My goals are to become a Pentester / Software Engineer and take my CISSP at 19 (if possible).

### More Information

I'm planning on taking the eJPT as my first cybersecurity certification. I have no other certs. I plan on taking the eCPPTv2 & OSCP following my attempt at the eJPT.
